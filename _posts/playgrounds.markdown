#Preface
My [scholarship submission](https://github.com/greenywd/Privacy-PlaygroundBook) for WWDC19 was a Playground Book, and a lot of my time was spent learning how Playground Books work and what they can do. Hopefully this post can assist anyone who would like to create one, for whatever reason.

#Introduction
Introduced in 2016, the Swift Playgrounds app on iOS allowed developers to run Swift code in real time, similar to Playgrounds on macOS within Xcode.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to begin creating a Playground Book is to download the [Swift Playgrounds Author Template](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=Swift%20Playgrounds%20Author%20Template) and open the Xcode project.
